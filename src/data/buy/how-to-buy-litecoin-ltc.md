  - title: Select the suitable Cryptocurrency Exchange
    description: If you want to buy LTC, you may use payment tools like Venmo and
      PayPal, or you can use Litecoin-specific wallets like Litewallet, a mobile
      app accessible on Google Play. This is mostly recommended for individuals
      who want to utilize LTC to make payments.  If you want to invest in
      Litecoin, you definitely need to register an account with a cryptocurrency
      exchange. You'll also want to make sure that the crypto exchange you
      choose supports Litecoin, which shouldn't be too difficult given how
      popular it is. Don't just pick any cryptocurrency exchange. Compare
      multiple exchanges based on their features, such as fees, security, and
      simplicity, and make a decision.
  - title: Buy Litecoin
    description: After deciding on a payment app or cryptocurrency exchange to
      acquire Litecoin, you must decide how to fund your transaction. If you've
      selected payment apps, you should fund your wallet by connecting a bank
      account or a debit card. After funding, you can execute your first
      Litecoin transaction. According to the app or exchange, the buying
      transactions might be as simple as a touch of a button, or you may need to
      input the ticker (LTC) and the quantity you wish to acquire. When your
      transaction is complete, you may get full or partial Litecoins. For
      example, if Litecoin is worth $10 and you invest $50, you will own 0.5
      LTC. If you spend $100, you will receive 1 LTC.
  - title: Store your Litecoin
    description: If you're new to cryptocurrency, you might not be used to having
      options for "storing" an asset. However, with Litecoin, you have various
      options. Most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges have built-in digital
      wallets where you can store your Litecoin and other cryptocurrency
      purchases. To keep your cryptocurrency safe from hackers, you can use a
      separate digital wallet that is not connected to the internet. While some
      people prefer to utilize big exchanges that have insurance against hacking
      incidents, you may want to keep your Litecoin in one of these offline
      wallets.
