bannerDesc: Our step-by-step guide on how to buy Dai (DAI). Dai is a stablecoin
  built on Ethereum. It is mostly used to lend and borrow cryptocurrency assets
  without the requirement for a middleman, resulting in a permissionless economy
  with little regulation. It was designed as a stablecoin and a collateral-based
  crypto, which means that the value isnâ€™t backed by US dollars.
