bannerDesc: Binance USD (BUSD), a well-known stable coin or cryptocurrency, is
  tied to the US dollar. This means that 1 BUSD is always available to buy and
  sell at 1 USD. Binance USD has been approved by the New York State Department
  of Financial Services (NYDFS), which is rather amazing given the American
  authorities' skepticism towards cryptocurrencies.
