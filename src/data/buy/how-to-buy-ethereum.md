  Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. Let us find out how to buy Ethereum
  in 4 easy steps.

  - title: Pick Crypto exchange of your choice
    description: "The first step in buying Ethereum is to choose a crypto exchange
      of your choice. You can choose from a large number of exchanges available
      such as Binance, eToro, WazirX, etc. The exchange is nothing but a
      platform where you buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. "
  - title: "Create an account "
    description: "Once you have finalised and have chosen a crypto exchange, the
      next step is to sign up on the platform. No matter which exchange you
      choose, you will be asked to submit a few details in order to verify your
      identity and youâ€™re good to go once it's approved. "
  - title: "Deposit Money "
    description: Once your account is approved you can deposit money on the crypto
      exchange. There are several different ways to deposit money via
      Credit/Debit card, Net Banking, PayPal. Select the method which suits you
      the best and deposit the sum. After your payment information has been
      verified for platforms using fiat cash, this may be rather simple. Simply
      add money using the debit card or bank account that is already set
      up.  Currency deposits in C2C exchanges can occasionally be a little more
      challenging. These exchanges demand that you transmit cryptocurrency
      between locations using a code. Having a lot of Ethereum on hand can be
      advantageous because it is a common depositing currency for many C2C
      services. Code transfers normally take up to an hour to complete, taking a
      little longer.

      As soon as the trade processes, Ethereum will be added to your wallet. "
